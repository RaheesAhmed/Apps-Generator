## App Generator

This is a coding App Generator I'm working on. It creates full codebases from a single prompt to an LLM using `GPT-4o` Model.

## Quick Start

Clone the repo

```
git clone
```

Install packages:

```
npm install or npm i
```

create new file `.env` and add your api key

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

```

Run the code:

```
node index.js
```
